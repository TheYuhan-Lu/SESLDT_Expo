# Before develpoment
Use this code to check if you have already installed all dependencies.
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn

```
We are using the Expo go app to run the project, Expo go has a lot of limitations

for the future we should switch from expo camera to react-native-camera

We can not use the camera as how to change some of the future like the fuclous and the zoom or the flash intensity
